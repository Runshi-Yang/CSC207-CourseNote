# Week 4

## 1. public variable OR privte variable + setter/getter?

* Case 1: 

    Example: Person class has variable "name"
```java
public class Person{
    private String name;
    ...
    public String getName {
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    ...
}
```
This is a good example, since a person's name can change.

* Case 2:

    Example: Student class has variable "stundentNum"
```js
public class Stundent{
    private String studentNum;
    ...
    public void setStudentNum(String studentNum) {
        this.studentNum = studentNum;
    }
    ...
}
```
This is a bad example, since a there is no reason for a student to change his studentNum.

* Case 3:

    Math class has variable "pi"
```js
public class Math{
    public static final pi = 3.14159;
}
```
Normally we try to make our variables private, but in this example, it is ok to make pi public.


## 2. JAVA Keywords
### Access Modifiers
* `public`: can be accessed by any classes
* `private`: cannot be accessed from outside of a class. 
* `protected`: only can be accessed by classes from the same package and a class' subclasses.
* Defult (when no other is present): only can be accessed by classes from the same package.

### Non-access Modifiers
* `static`: applicable to a block, a variable, a method, a class

    When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among all objects at the class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.

    If you need to do the computation in order to initialize your static variables, you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded. 

    ```java
    class Test{
    // static variable
    static int a = 10;
    static int b;
      
    // static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block initialized.");
        b = a * 4;
    }

    ...

    }
    ``` 

* `final`: applicable to a variable, a method or a class.

    When a variable is declared with final keyword, its value canâ€™t be modified, essentially, a constant.

    Methods are declared final to prevent overriding.

    Classes are declared final to prevent inheritance.

* `abstract`: applicable to a method or a class.

    The class which is having partial implementation(i.e. not all methods present in the class have method body). This is an example declaring a class to be abstract:
    ```java
    // Class 1
    // Abstract class
    abstract class Base {
        abstract void fun();
    }
 
    // Class 2
    class Derived extends Base {
        void fun() {
        System.out.println("Derived fun() called");
        }
    }
    ```



## 3. Some Intellj shortcuts

* **Find out where a method or variable is used**: Command + click
* **Extract a method**: Choose the piece of code you want to extract -> Refactor -> Refactor this... -> Extract Method -> Change function name

The extracted method is private since it is only used in the same class.
